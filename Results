Using a similarity measure we were able to classify several typical market states between which the market jumps back and forth.
Some of these states can easily be identified in this similarity measure. However, there are several states in which the market 
only stays for a short period. Thus, these states are sparsely embedded in time. With a k-means clustering analysis,
we were able to identify these states and disclose a detailed dynamics of the market's state.
